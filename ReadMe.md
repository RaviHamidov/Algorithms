    - SumFuntion
        - Type a function called sum. An array of function numbers
        i parameter and return the sum of all elements of the array
    - RandomNumber
        - Type a function called random. The function must take two parameters,
        lower and upper, and return an arbitrary natural number between
        those two numbers (including both)
    - ArithmeticMean
        - Type a function called arithmeticMean. Your function is an array
        of numbers i should be taken as a parameter and the numerical mean
        of the elements of the array must return
    - GeometricMean
        - Type a function called geometricMean. Your function is an array
        of numbers i should be taken as a parameter and the geometric mean
        of the elements of the array must return
    - EuclideanDistance
        - Type a function called euclideanDistance. The function takes two
        vectors as parameters should and they should return the Euclidean
        distance. When we say vector We are talking about an array of two
        additional elements. The first element of the array is x the second
        element y i denotes: [x, y].
    - PickOne
        - Type a function called pickOne. The function must accept an array
        of numbers and from within must return an arbitrary elements
    - Includes
        - Type a function called includes. Function to search for one array
        and one number must accept value. If that value exists within the
        array, true otherwise it must return false
    - Unique 
        - Type a function called unique. The function must return an array
        of parameters to a new array that does not contain repeating
        elements
    - InterSection 
        - Write a function called intersection. The function should take
        two arrays as a parameter and return their intersection as a new
        array
