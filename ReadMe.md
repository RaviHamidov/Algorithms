## SelfLearning Solutions
- 1.) SumFuntion
    - Type a function called sum. An array of function numbers
    i parameter and return the sum of all elements of the array

- 2.) RandomNumber
    - Type a function called random. The function must take two parameters, lower and upper, and return an arbitrary natural number
    between those two numbers (including both)

- 3.) ArithmeticMean
    - Type a function called arithmeticMean. Your function is an array
    of numbers i should be taken as a parameter and the numerical mean
    of the elements of the array must return

- 4.) GeometricMean
    - Type a function called geometricMean. Your function is an array
    of numbers i should be taken as a parameter and the geometric mean
    of the elements of the array must return

- 5.) EuclideanDistance
    - Type a function called euclideanDistance. The function takes two
    vectors as parameters should and they should return the Euclidean
    distance. When we say vector We are talking about an array of two
    additional elements. The first element of the array is x the second
    element y i denotes: [x, y].

- 6.) PickOne 
    - Type a function called pickOne. The function must accept an array
    of numbers and from within must return an arbitrary elements

- 7.) Includes
    - Type a function called includes. Function to search for one array
    and one number must accept value. If that value exists within the
    array, true otherwise it must return false

- 8.) Unique 
    - Type a function called unique. The function must return an array
    of parameters to a new array that does not contain repeating
    elements

- 9.) InterSection 
    - Write a function called intersection. The function should take
    two arrays as a parameter and return their intersection as a new
    array

- 10.) Flat2D
    - Type a function called flat2D. The function must take one
    two-dimensional array i as a parameter and return a new one-dimensional array

- 11.) Union
    - Type a function called union. The function should take two arrays i
    as a parameter and must return their combination as a new array

- 12.) Reverse 
    - Type a function called reverse. The function must take an array i as a parameter and must return its inverse as a new array

- 13.) Map 
    - Type a function called map. The function is an array i and a
    function should be taken as a parameter, the result of the function
    to each element of the array must apply and return a new array
